      <description>The UROP is still in progress and the page will be updated!
I am working as part of Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at the Information Processing and Communications Lab in Imperial College London. I have worked on privacy aware data sharing for the new generation electricity supply network, using Reinforcement Learning.
In the new generation electricity supply networks, smart meters play a key role in recording the electricity consumption of a household and report it to the utility provider in real time.</description>

      <description>EPIC IMPOC is a clinical decision support system used in the NHS to improve the management of infectious diseases by facilitating data collection, infection diagnostics and antimicrobial therapy advice at the point of care.
In the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we implemented a new module in EPIC IMPOC (Enhanced, Personalized and Integrated Care for Infection Management at the Point of Care), specifically to provide aid to clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 patients and treat them by retrieving similar cases.</description>

      <description>During my 12 weeks internship, I was a content creator intern in the Arm University Program. I worked on revamping one of the educational kits, Rapid Embedded Design and Programming Online Course, under the supervision of my line manager.
The Rapid Embedded Design and Programming Online Course is a 10/14 weeks university course which aims to help the student develop their skills of using high level programming tools and languages to rapidly design and program Arm-based embedded systems and prototype them for various applications.</description>
