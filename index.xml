      <description>With the advance of smartphones, wearables devices, and other Internet of Things devices, there is a variety of sensors that are generating time-series measurements of your daily activity. These sensors allow the emergence of new services that are beneficial to several areas including health monitoring, safety, and productivity. While cameras, microphones, and the location are preserved as privacy-sensitive, the privacy implication of activity recognition sensors is still underestimated. In fact, the detailed time-series user data shared with untrusted third parties could be used to infer private and sensitive information user information (e.</description>

      <description>I am working as part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at the Information Processing and Communications Lab at Imperial College London.
Privacy-Aware Sharing in Smart Grids (canceled) In the new generation electricity supply networks, smart meters play a key role in recording the electricity consumption of a household by reporting it to the utility provider in real-time. However, this real-time information also carries sensitive personal information about the user’s activities.</description>

      <description>Everybody has head about COVID The first case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, China, on December 31st, 2019. Soon after, the WHO has characterized this viral disease as a global pandemic. Many governments have imposed a lockdown to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed and limit the spread of the disease. Since then, the COVID-19 has seriously impacted businesses and the economy. It also has been had serious implications for people&amp;rsquo;s livelihoods and health.</description>

      <description>The aim is to make a usable untyped functional language system all written in F# which allows the implementation of pure functional features like Church numbers.
The work modularises as:
 Lexer Parser Lambda closure runtime system  The lexer performs lexical analysis, the process of converting the stream of characters to words (&amp;lsquo;tokens&amp;rsquo;). The parser then uses these tokens to find the relationship between them and determine the syntax. In other words, the parser converts the tokens to a syntax tree that can be used by the run time to give an output.</description>

      <description>We have implemented a smart baby monitor that records the temperature of a baby regularly and saves it on an online database, Firebase. It uses machine learning to check if the baby is crying or not.
An android user-friendly mobile application has been made so that the parents can receive notifications and check on the baby&amp;rsquo;s current temperature and its history using Java as a programming language.   Screenshot of the mobile application&amp;#39;s main view   The ARM microcontroller is programmed to collect the read the data from the sensor using I2C protocol and C++ as a programming language.</description>

      <description>During my 12 weeks internship, I was a content creator intern in the Arm University Program. I worked on revamping one of the educational kits, Rapid Embedded Design and Programming Online Course, under the supervision of my line manager.
The Rapid Embedded Design and Programming Online Course is a 10/14 weeks university course. It aims to help the student develop their skills of using high-level programming tools and languages to rapidly design and program ARM-based embedded systems and prototype them for various applications.</description>

      <description>NAVGATE is a fully automated indoor navigation system that will equip airport terminals with the technology of the future which will improve the overall airport experience. With NAVGATE, users will be able to move around the airport easily, independently and confidently. A simple 3 part system consisting of localization system, our advanced Haptic Belt to guide the user and a user-friendly app is the key.
Our mobile will give the user directions to the Boarding Gate, restaurants and even the restroom all easily accessible within the users mobile phone via the app.</description>

      <description>This project aims to implement a remotely-controlled rover that can explore a hazardous storeroom and identify unusual material that would emit a combination of different signals (infrared and radio signals) using C++ as a computer language and Arduino IDE as a development tool.
As part of the project, I have worked on the implementation of the sensors, the mobile application design, the user interface, the intelligent unit, and the maneuverability of the rover.</description>

      <description>The mastermind game is a board game which opposes a code maker and a code breaker. The code maker will have to come up with a random sequence of colors, and the codebreaker will have to try and find it. At every attempt, the code maker will have to give feedback to the codebreaker. My objective was to build an effective and non-time consuming solver. I have done so using a Genetic Algorithm coded in C++.</description>

      <description>I have participated in an innovation camp around solving an environmental problem related to waste (2 weeks). To solve the problem, I have made a semi-functional platform that connects NGOs that are already working on recycling or reusing the waste with the private sector.
As part of the camp, I have developed a business scheme as well as a mobile app, using JAVA as a computer language. I have pitched my idea to the minister of communication, a representative of the prime minister, and the CEO of Touch (one of the Leading Telecommunication companies in Lebanon) at the Government Palace.</description>
