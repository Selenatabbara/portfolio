      <description>We have implemented a smart baby monitor that record the regularly the temperature of a baby and save it on online database. It uses machine learning to check if the baby is crying or not.
An android user friendly mobile application has been made so that the parents can receiver notification and check on the baby&amp;rsquo;s temperature and its history using Java as a programming language.   Screenshot of the mobile application&amp;#39;s main view   The ARM microcontroller is programmed to collect the read the data from the sensor using I2C protocol and C++ as a programming language.</description>

      <description>NAVGATE is a fully automated indoor navigation system that will equip airport terminals with the technology of the future which will improve the overall airport experience. With NAVGATE, users will be able to move around the airport easily, independently and confidently. A simple 3 part system consisting of localization system, our advanced Haptic Belt to guide the user and a user-friendly app is the key.
Our mobile will give the user directions to the Boarding Gate, restaurants and even the restroom all easily accessible within the users mobile phone via the app.</description>

      <description>The aim of this project is to implement a remotely-controlled rover that can explore a hazardous store room and identify unusual material that would emit a combination of different signals (infrared and radio signals) using C++ as a computer language and Arduino IDE as a development tool.
As part of the project I have worked on the implementation of the sensors, the mobile application design, the user interface, the intelligent unit, the maneuverability of the rover.</description>

      <description>I have participated in an innovation camp around solving an environmental problem related to waste (2 weeks). To solve the problem, I have made a semi-functional platform which connects NGO that are already working recycling or reusing the waste with the private sector.
As part of the camp I have developed a business scheme as well as a mobile app, using JAVA as a computer language. I have pitched my idea during a speech to the minister of communication and a representative of the prime minister at the Government Palace.</description>
